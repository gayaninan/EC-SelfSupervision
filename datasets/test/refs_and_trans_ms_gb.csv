Yeah, so there's a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests. So one of them you're right.

Yeah. Possibly so. We do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac. That kind of upset your stomach, especially if you're not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it. So we need to be might need to address that.

So, yeah, I think there's a few different things it could be. I noticed that you've not had a colonoscopy for quite some time. In fact, not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed. So we might need to look at repeating that. I think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers. And we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure there's no infection. And also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin. And, that's to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohn's disease. I think depending on what those are, well, maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel. So I think that's that's what we are doing just at that the moment. How does that sound to you? 	So yeah, I think there's a few different things it could be.

Tigers outside to you, 
Yeah. I mean, yes. Yeah, that's that's all right. Yeah, I just Yeah, I didn't really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in. 	yes, was that?

Any other questions? 	any other questions. 
Yeah. Do you think I need to change my medication to something else? 	Do you think I need to change my medication to something else
So one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the Adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug. But at the moment, I wouldn't change you from your Adalimumab just until we've got a bit more information about what's going on. 	so one of the things we can do is cheque?

Okay. You think I might need more surgery? 	Okay. You think I might need more surgery? 
Well, again, it depends a little bit on the investigations. We might, you know, depending on what they show we might need to go on and get MRI scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there aren't any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time. If that's the case, then we might need to look at surgery. But that's a lot further down the line for a moment. Okay. 	Well again it depends a little bit on the investigations.

So there's a few different things that could be going on. One of them could be that, as you sort of alluded to yourself that you might be coming. Your body's not responding as well to the Adalimumab so one of the things that we'll do today is check the levels of the drug in your body to make sure that your body is handling it as it should be. It could also be that your crohn's disease is a bit more active than usual, so one of the things that we can do for that is check up fecal calprotectin which you will probably have had done before.

Yeah. 	an. 
And that's just a stool test to check the inflammation. We also need to send some samples off to make sure there's no infection there as well.
