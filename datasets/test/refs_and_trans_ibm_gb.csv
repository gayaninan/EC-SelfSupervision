Yeah	<>
Or what do you think?	or what do you think
Yeah, so there's a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests. So one of them you're right. It could be that the Adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness, which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well.	so there's a few things that might be going on to a need to do a few different test so one of them you're right it could be that they have a lot of mobs can have lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing and a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also and sometimes you can develop antibodies against the drug as well
Okay.	<>
And which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that. And the other thing is that because you've had surgery in the past, that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if you've got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions. But that's quite easy to check for us well.	and which can make it an effective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because you and had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect home something called the bile salts get reabsorbed and and a sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if if you phone got high levels of bile salts in in your building options and that's quite easy to to check for as well
Okay.	<>
And of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well, so the other thing we'll arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which you've probably done before,	and of course you need to also think about whether your diseases actually freezing up as well so the other thing will arrange to do as a physical card protecting which is probably down before
Yeah	<>
just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel. So if that's high, we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes.	it's just a stupid text to check for information and the and the barrel and so if that's high we might need to look at your medication and and thank you very meaning some changes
Okay	<>
Do you have any questions about all of that? Quite a lot of information.	do you have any questions about all of that get a lot of information.
Yeah it's okay. If you do need to change my medication like, what would be the next step?	You do need to change my Medicaid what would be the next step
So there's a few different options. So there is a medication called and infliximab, which is similar to Adalimumab. Or we might look at you know, switching you to a completely different drug um as well. Also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab. But yeah, I think first of all, we'll get some up to date tests on first. Might need to get a CT scan or also an MRI scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if there's any inflammation in the bowel that might be, you know, causing your symptoms.	so and there's a few different options and so there is a medication called infliximab which is similar to other with a match and or we might look at moving you know switching into a completely different drugs and as well also also called a biologic but a different works in a different way and the body computers and I. But yes I think first of all we'll get some up to the test and first and might get a CT scan or also an MRI scan of your small barrel just to have a look and see if any and information on the ballot might be you know causing a second
And I had surgery before my treatment wasn't working. Do you think that's a possibility in the future?	and I had to do before my treatment wasn't working do you think that's a possibility in the future
So I mean, it's always possible we have to always keep it at the back of our mind. And hopefully they you know, we can try and work out what's going on and that do something medically. But yeah ofcourse, we have to always think about surgery is as a possibility.	so I mean it's always possible we have to always keep at the back of our mind and hopefully they you know we can try and work out what's going on and do something medically but yes because they have to deal with think about so G. as as a possibility

Seven it will be called chronic conditions with something that you're going to have life long unfortunately and but it's a condition that we can control very well with medications and the vast majority of people so to start with will start you on a course of steroids I don't think you had any from your GP yet but I'm that should help to sort of calm down the inflammation in your bill and then we'll get you started on some other maintenance say the peace and a mobile internet is of that and the next consultation. Do you have any questions about that just at the moment. 
Um, so, um, yeah, sorry, it's just lot to take in. 	So. Yeah I just saw its wealth taken. 
Sure, 	<>
So how long will be on these steroids for? Is that for lifelong? 	So how long will be on this the steroids for is that for life long 
So the steroids are normally just for 8 to 68 weeks until the inflammation has has died down. 	said I don't normally just four eight sixty eight weeks until the inflammation has has died down
Right. 	<> 
And hopefully your bowel have it should be going back to normal.	and hopefully your balance have it should be going back to normal 
Okay.	<>
And you should know it's less blood as well. If that doesn't happen with the steroids, then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations. But in terms of maintenance therapies that we talked about, you will be on those for longer term. And often people are on them lifelong or certainly for years, depending on the course of their disease. 	and you should notice less blood as well and if that doesn't happen with this data is then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some some further investigations but in terms of maintenance database that we talked about you will be on those for a longer term and often people are only lifelong or certainly for years depending on the course of their disease
Okay. 	okay 
Okay? So and we'll also have to arrange some surveillance colonoscopy for you as well just to make sure that you don't develop other conditions that are associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Okay? 	so what I am and will also have to arrange some surveillance colonoscopy for you as well as take and make sure that you don't develop other conditions that are associated with inflammatory members. 
Okay. 	Okay
So we'll arrange it to see you back in clinic in about six weeks time, for a review. Thank you.	so what I needed to see about a clinic in about six weeks time but if you. Thank you.

Um yes, I've got I've got arthritis, and I've also got hay fever and asthma as well. 	yes I've got a I've got a flatus and and for some got a fever and and excellent as well 
And any other medications that you're on? Other than the Adalimumab.  	and any other medications that you're on other than the adults. 
So, I take, I take some diclofenac. That's for my my arthritis. 	So some of them some medical Fenech that's from my my status. 
All right, okay. 	<>
It helps my pain. 	<>
Are you taking that regularly? 	People taking out regularly.
Yeah. 	<>
Yeah?. 	<>
I'd say so. 	<>
Have you noticed any stomach upset with that? 	Stomach upset with that 
I mean, well, I suppose I have to have this abdominal pain in my tummy. So I don't know. Could that be? Could be connected to that?	I mean well without the other Saddam opinion. Tony so I I don't know if it could not be connected to that. 
Yeah. Possibly so. We do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac. That kind of upset your stomach, especially if you're not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it. So we need to be might need to address that. Do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss. 	Possibly and find people who are on long term. Medications like. Account your stomach especially if you're not taking on a prison or a. Indication like that with it we need to be might need to address that and do you have any insider ideas about what might be causing your symptoms of plenty the diary and. 
And well, I suppose I just assumed that's my crohn's with that was being watery, but I don't know about, but do you think it could be anything else? 	But well with both been watching but I mean I don't know either but do you think it could be anything else. 
So, yeah, I think there's a few different things it could be. I noticed that you've not had a colonoscopy for quite some time. In fact, not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed. So we might need to look at repeating that. I think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers. And we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure there's no infection. And also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin. And, that's to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohn's disease. I think depending on what those are, well, maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel. So I think that's that's what we are doing just at that the moment. How does that sound to you? 	Yeah I think there's a few different things it could be I noticed that you've not had a colonoscopy for quite some time and in fact not sent you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might be to look at and repeating that and I think in the first instance will get some blood test off to check in flashing marketers and we need to send some samples of your still often make sure there's no infection and also send office specials to test called faecal Caltech them and that's a look for inflammation in your valuable that might be related to the Crohn's disease I think depending on what those are well maybe deciding whether you need another time. At the tail end to have a look at the the lining of the bone. And so I think that's that's what we'll be doing just at the moment how does that sound to you. 
Yeah. I mean, yes. Yeah, that's that's all right. Yeah, I just Yeah, I didn't really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in. 	That's the. I'm just yeah that I didn't really think about getting all these tests in the same year. What what to take in. 
Of course.	<>
But yeah, I understand. 	Yeah yeah I understand and. 
Any other questions? 	<>
Yeah. Do you think I need to change my medication to something else? 	Yes I think I need to change rate medication to something else. 
So one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the Adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug. But at the moment, I wouldn't change you from your Adalimumab just until we've got a bit more information about what's going on. 	One of the things we can do is check the the level of the medication and your blood and called it adult profile or checking the antibody sending and the level of the drug but at the moment I wouldn't change you from Adelaide about just until we've got a bit more information about what's going on. 
Okay. You think I might need more surgery? 	I think I might need more surgery in. 
Well, again, it depends a little bit on the investigations. We might, you know, depending on what they show we might need to go on and get MRI scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there aren't any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time. If that's the case, then we might need to look at surgery. But that's a lot further down the line for a moment. Okay. 	Well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they should we might need to go on and get. Of your builders to have a look and make sure there aren't any other points of narrowing in the barrel like you had last time and if that's the case then we might need to look at surgery but that's a lot further down the line.

Okay, 	Okay. 
And that could be quite unwell with that, So I'm quite worried, but that's what's going to happen to me as well. 	That sounds quite worried but that's. As well. 
Okay, so at the moment we need to take some stool cultures from you. I think you've had some sent, but we need to send a couple more just to exclude any infection. We also need to arrange an urgent colonoscopy for you. So that I'm sure your mom have had one of those before, so it's basically a camera test. It goes into your bowel and has a look, and we take photographs and take biopsies to try and diagnose you with what we think is inflammatory bowel disease. Okay?. There are a couple of different types of inflammatory bowel disease. So one is called ulcerative colitis like your mom has, and the other one is called crohn's disease. And so they are similar in many ways. But there are key differences in terms of how we manage people, so that's what we'll do at the moment, for today, we'll start you on something called Pentesia, which is to try and help reduce any inflammation in the bowel. And then once we get a formal diagnosis from biopsies and things, we'll hopefully aim to start you on some steroids to reduce the inflammation. Okay. Does that sound okay? 	Sure at the moment and we need to take some still cultures from you I think it had some sent but we need to send a couple more just to exclude any infection we also need to arrange an urgent colonoscopy for you and so that said I'm sure you your mumble had one of those before so it's basically a camera test that goes into your battle and has a looking we take photographs and take biopsies to try and and diagnose you with what we think is informative overseas okay there are a couple of different types of information overseas so one is called alternative collectors like your mum has and the other one's called Crohn's disease and so they are. Similar in many ways but there are key differences in terms of how we manage people so that's what we'll be at the moment for today and we will start you on something called temptation which is to try and help reduce any inflammation in the barrel and and then once we get a formal diagnosis from biopsies and things will hopefully in to start your time steroids to reduce the information. Does that sound okay. 
Yeah, that sounds okay. 	Yeah 
Yeah?. 	<>
Yeah. 	<>
Do you have any questions about all of that or? 	do you have any questions about all the. 
So do I have to be on medications forever. 	So I have to be on medications for ever 
So it's very dependent on the patient or on the person who some people respond very well to initial therapy. And they might remain well for years with a normal bowel habit and will kind of see you or speak to you from clinic. You know, maybe every six months for a year to see how you're getting on and decides if you can come off medication so some people stay on medication, lifelong, and some people manage to come off it. 	so it very dependent on on the patient or the person to some people respond very well to initial thirty P. and they might remain well for years with the bank have it and and will kind of SCO or or speaking it from clinic you know maybe if it's six months or a year to see how you're getting on and decide if you can come off medication to some people their medication lifelong and some people managed to come off it. 
Okay. 	<>

What do you think is causing my symptoms of the moment? 	What do you think scores in my symptoms and I'm 
So there's a few different things that could be going on. One of them could be that, as you sort of alluded to yourself that you might be coming. Your body's not responding as well to the Adalimumab so one of the things that we'll do today is check the levels of the drug in your body to make sure that your body is handling it as it should be. It could also be that your crohn's disease is a bit more active than usual, so one of the things that we can do for that is check up fecal calprotectin which you will probably have had done before. 	sure there's a few different things that could be going on and one of them could be that as usual for alluded to yourself that you might be coming your body is not responding as well to the Adelaide map shows one of the things that will do today is check the levels of the drug in your body to make sure that your body's handling it as it should be and it could also be that your Crohn's disease is a bit more active than usual so one of the things that we can do for that is check out faecal contradicted which you'll probably have had done before 
Yeah. 	<>
And that's just a stool test to check the inflammation. We also need to send some samples off to make sure there's no infection there as well. And we'll do some bloods to make sure you are not a knee make or needing any sort of a placement of your electrolytes. Okay. What how does that sound to you? 	and and that's just the stupidest check for information. And we also need to send some samples off to make sure there's no infection there as well and and we'll do some blood tests to make sure you're not in the make or needing any server placement of your electrolytes. But how does that sound to you 
You know, that sounds fine. I'm just worried that I'll need to change my medication. And I've been getting on quite well with the Adalimumab. 	yeah that sounds fine just worried that I'll need to change my medication and I get along quite well with the other woman 
Yeah. 	yes 
So just a bit worried about that. 	just a bit worried about that 
Must be a bit disappointing when it's been working so well. 	must be a bit disappointing when it's been working so well 
Yeah. 	<>
Okay, I think we'll first of all, get these basic investigations off, it might be that we need to go on and get some more imaging of your abdomen in terms of MRI scans or CT scans and also do a camera test or a colonoscopy to have a look at the tail end. But we'll start with the basic investigations first, and then we can decide about medication after. Does that sound okay? 	okay I think we'll first of all get these basic investigations off and it might be that we need to go on and get some more imaging of your abdomen in terms of MRI scans or CT scans and also do a camera test or a colonoscopy to have a look at the tail end but we'll start with the basic elect investigations first and then we can decide about medication after.

Okay. 	okay. 
I just don't want more surgery. 	More sorry 
Well, it usually is a last resort for the people with inflammatory bowel disease. So we'll do what we can with medication, and hopefully you respond. There are things we can do with your Adalimumab to increase its dose or increase the frequency as well. So there there are definitely other options other than surgery at the moment. 	well it usually is a last resort for for people with inflammatory bowel disease so we'll do what we can with medication and hopefully you respond there are things we can do with your adolescent mounted increase its doors or increase the frequency as well so there there are definitely other options other than surgery at the moment
