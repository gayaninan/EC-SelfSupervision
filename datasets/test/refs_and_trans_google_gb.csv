Okay. So your stool cultures have been negative. So that's the exclude any infective cause of your diarrhoea. And, obviously, you've had your colonoscopy, and we took some biopsy results.

Okay, so it's sort of chronic inflammatory disease affecting predominantly the bowel, but it can affect other parts of the body, like skin, joints, sometimes even the eyes.

So everyone's a little bit different in terms of how their disease course progresses. Um, some people are, you know, very well controlled on therapy for for years. And some people have a bit more of a rough ride and require other medications to be added in as well. So we'll keep you on it for you know, at least the first year or so, and then we'll review things after that. And, but also with colitis is a chronic long term condition that you'll have for the rest of your life and have to sort of learn to live with as well, but there's lots of support available for you as well so. 	everyone's a little bit different in terms of how they're disease course progresses some people are you know very controlled on therapy for 3 years and some people having it more of a rough ride and require other medications to be added in as well so we'll keep you on it for you know at least one review thing is after that and the ulcerative colitis is a chronic a long-term condition that you have for the rest of your life and learn to live with as well it's like to support available

Yeah	<>
Or what do you think?	or what do you think
Yeah, so there's a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests. So one of them you're right. It could be that the Adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness, which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well.	there's a few things that might be going on still need to do a few different test so one of them you're right it could be that the atom abs lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can take for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also sometimes you can develop antibodies against the drug as well
Okay.	<>
And which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that. And the other thing is that because you've had surgery in the past, that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if you've got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions. But that's quite easy to check for us well.	and which can make it an effective so we can you check that the other thing is that because you've had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts getting reabsorbed and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if you got high levels of bile salts and you're going motions but that's quite easy to take for as well
Okay.	<>
And of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well, so the other thing we'll arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which you've probably done before,	and of course you need to think about whether you're diseases actually saving up as well so the other thing will arrange to do as a faecal calprotectin which you probably done before
Yeah	<>
just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel. So if that's high, we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes.	it's just a stool test to check for inflammation in the so if that's how you remind me to look at your medication and and thank you about making some changes
Okay	ok
Do you have any questions about all of that? Quite a lot of information.	do you have any questions about all of that lot of information
Yeah it's okay. If you do need to change my medication like, what would be the next step?	you do need to take my medication like what will be the next step
So there's a few different options. So there is a medication called and infliximab, which is similar to Adalimumab. Or we might look at you know, switching you to a completely different drug um as well. Also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab. But yeah, I think first of all, we'll get some up to date tests on first. Might need to get a CT scan or also an MRI scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if there's any inflammation in the bowel that might be, you know, causing your symptoms.	so there's a few different options so that is a medication called infliximab which is similar to add a little man or might look at me you know switching you take completely different drug and as well also called a biologic but a different works in a different way and the body it's gone feudalism bad but yeah I will get some up-to-date test done first and might need to get a CT scan or also and MRI scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if there's any and inflammation in the bowel symptoms
And I had surgery before my treatment wasn't working. Do you think that's a possibility in the future?	before achievement wasn't working do you think that's a possibility in the future
So I mean, it's always possible we have to always keep it at the back of our mind. And hopefully they you know, we can try and work out what's going on and that do something medically. But yeah ofcourse, we have to always think about surgery is as a possibility.	so it's always possible we have to keep it at the back of hopefully the you know we can try and work out what's going on and do something medically but yeah of course I have to think about surgery as a possibility

Okay, so it's what we call a chronic condition. So it's something that you're going to have life long, unfortunately, um but it's a condition that we can control very well with medications, in the vast majority of people. So to start with, we'll start you on a course of steroids. I don't think you've had any from your GP yet, but that should help to sort of calm down the inflammation in your bowel and then we'll get you started on some other maintenance therapies I'm going into details of that on at the next consultation.

Just at the moment?. 	is what we call a chronic condition so it's something that you're going to have lifelong unfortunately but it's a condition that we can control very well with medications in the vast majority of people start with will start you on a course of steroids I don't think you had any from your GP yet but that should help to sort of calm down inflammation in your bowel and then we'll get you start some other maintenance therapy go into details of that on at the next consultation do you have any questions about that just at the moment

And often people are on them lifelong or certainly for years, depending on the course of their disease. 	you should know is less blood as well if that doesn't happen with the steroids then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations in terms of maintenance therapies that we talked about you will be on those for longer-term and often people are on them lifelong or certainly 4 years depending on the course of their disease

Um yes, I've got I've got arthritis, and I've also got hay fever and asthma as well. 	got arthritis and a false FIFA and eczema as well 
And any other medications that you're on? Other than the Adalimumab.  	<>
So, I take, I take some diclofenac. That's for my my arthritis. 	<>
All right, okay. 	<>
It helps my pain. 	<>
Are you taking that regularly? 	<>
Yeah. 	<>
Yeah?. 	<>
I'd say so. 	<>
Have you noticed any stomach upset with that? 	<>
I mean, well, I suppose I have to have this abdominal pain in my tummy. So I don't know. Could that be? Could be connected to that?	as that you're on about that from this a domino pain in my tummy so I could possibly I'm so would 
Yeah. Possibly so. We do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac. That kind of upset your stomach, especially if you're not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it. So we need to be might need to address that. Do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss. 	you find people here on long-term non-steroidal medications like diclofenac an upset your stomach especially if you're not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it so we need to be might need to address that do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms with the diary and 
And well, I suppose I just assumed that's my crohn's with that was being watery, but I don't know about, but do you think it could be anything else? 	do you think it could be anything else 
So, yeah, I think there's a few different things it could be. I noticed that you've not had a colonoscopy for quite some time. In fact, not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed. So we might need to look at repeating that. I think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers. And we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure there's no infection. And also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin. And, that's to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohn's disease. I think depending on what those are, well, maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel. So I think that's that's what we are doing just at that the moment. How does that sound to you? 	shortly after you were diagnosed so we might meet a look at and repeating that I think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check inflammatory markers we need to send some samples of your stools off to make sure there's no infection and also send off a special school test called faecal calprotectin and that's to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the Crohn's disease I think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up at the tail End to have a look at the the lining of the bowel so I think that's stop of eating just at the moment how does that sound to you 
Yeah. I mean, yes. Yeah, that's that's all right. Yeah, I just Yeah, I didn't really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in. 	<>
Of course.	<>
But yeah, I understand. 	<>
Any other questions? 	any other questions 
Yeah. Do you think I need to change my medication to something else? 	you think I need to change my medication to something else 
So one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the Adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug. But at the moment, I wouldn't change you from your Adalimumab just until we've got a bit more information about what's going on. 	to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adult profile or taking your antibodies and the the level of the drug the moment I wouldn't change you from your Adam ajis until we got a bit more information about what's going on 
Okay. You think I might need more surgery? 	<>
Well, again, it depends a little bit on the investigations. We might, you know, depending on what they show we might need to go on and get MRI scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there aren't any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time. If that's the case, then we might need to look at surgery. But that's a lot further down the line for a moment. Okay. 	again it depends on the investigations we might you know depending on what the Show we might need to go on and get an MRI scan of of your barrel just to have a look and meet you there any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if that's the case then we might need to look at surgery but that's a lot further down the line at the moment ok 
Okay. Thank you very much.	<>

Okay, so at the moment we need to take some stool cultures from you. I think you've had some sent, but we need to send a couple more just to exclude any infection. We also need to arrange an urgent colonoscopy for you. So that I'm sure your mom have had one of those before, so it's basically a camera test. It goes into your bowel and has a look, and we take photographs and take biopsies to try and diagnose you with what we think is inflammatory bowel disease. Okay?. There are a couple of different types of inflammatory bowel disease. So one is called ulcerative colitis like your mom has, and the other one is called crohn's disease. And so they are similar in many ways. But there are key differences in terms of how we manage people, so that's what we'll do at the moment, for today, we'll start you on something called Pentesia, which is to try and help reduce any inflammation in the bowel. And then once we get a formal diagnosis from biopsies and things, we'll hopefully aim to start you on some steroids to reduce the inflammation. Okay. Does that sound okay? 	ok that's ok so at the moment we need to take some stew cultures from you I think you've had some sent but need to send a couple more just to exclude any infection we also need to arrange an urgent colonoscopy for you so that's I'm sure your mum had one for so it's basically a camera test that goes into your bowel and has a low can we take photographs and take biopsies to try and diagnose you with what we think is inflammatory bowels OK they are couple of different types of inflammatory bowel disease so one is called ulcerative colitis like your mum has and the other one is called Crohn's disease and so they are similar and key differences in terms of how we manage people so that's what will be at the moment for today we'll start you on something called pen Theatre which is Angel produce any inflammation in the bowel and then once we get a formal diagnosis from biopsies and things will hopefully into start you on some steroids to reduce the information does that sound ok that sounds ok

Do you have any questions about all of that or? 	do you have any questions about all that or 
So do I have to be on medications forever. 	your medications forever 
So it's very dependent on the patient or on the person who some people respond very well to initial therapy. And they might remain well for years with a normal bowel habit and will kind of see you or speak to you from clinic. You know, maybe every six months for a year to see how you're getting on and decides if you can come off medication so some people stay on medication, lifelong, and some people manage to come off it. 	so it's very dependent on on the patient Touran some people respond very well to initial therapy and they might remain well for years with a normal bowel habit and will kind of see you or speak to you it from clinic you know maybe if you want to see how you're getting on and decide if you can come off medication so some people they are medication lifelong and some people manage to come off it

What do you think is causing my symptoms of the moment? 	what do you think my symptoms are moment 
So there's a few different things that could be going on. One of them could be that, as you sort of alluded to yourself that you might be coming. Your body's not responding as well to the Adalimumab so one of the things that we'll do today is check the levels of the drug in your body to make sure that your body is handling it as it should be. It could also be that your crohn's disease is a bit more active than usual, so one of the things that we can do for that is check up fecal calprotectin which you will probably have had done before. 	different things that could be going on one of them could be that as you needed to yourself that you might be coming your body is not responding as well to the adult and one of the things that will do today's check the levels of the drug in your body to make sure that your body is handling it as it should be it could also be that your Crohn's disease is active than usual so one of the things that we can do for that is checkout faecal calprotectin which will probably have had done before 
Yeah. 	<>
And that's just a stool test to check the inflammation. We also need to send some samples off to make sure there's no infection there as well. And we'll do some bloods to make sure you are not a knee make or needing any sort of a placement of your electrolytes. Okay. What how does that sound to you? 	and that's just a stool test to check for inflammation and will need to send some samples off to make sure there's no infection there is well and we'll do some bloods to make sure you're not anemic or needing any sort of a placement of your electric what how does that sound to you

Must be a bit disappointing when it's been working so well. 	must be a bit disappointing when it's been working so well 
Yeah. 	<>
Okay, I think we'll first of all, get these basic investigations off, it might be that we need to go on and get some more imaging of your abdomen in terms of MRI scans or CT scans and also do a camera test or a colonoscopy to have a look at the tail end. But we'll start with the basic investigations first, and then we can decide about medication after.

Just took me quite a long time to recover last time. 	<>
Okay. 	<>
I just don't want more surgery. 	<>
Well, it usually is a last resort for the people with inflammatory bowel disease. So we'll do what we can with medication, and hopefully you respond. There are things we can do with your Adalimumab to increase its dose or increase the frequency as well. So there there are definitely other options other than surgery at the moment. 	for people with inflammatory bowel disease so will do what we can with medication and hopefully responded things we can do with your adimab to increase its doors or increase the frequency there are definitely other options other than surgery at the moment
