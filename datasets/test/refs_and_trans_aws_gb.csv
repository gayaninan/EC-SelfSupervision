Yeah	<>
Or what do you think?	or what do you think?
Yeah, so there's a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests. So one of them you're right. It could be that the Adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness, which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well.	So there's a few things that might be going on to will need to do a few different tests. So one of them you're right. It could be that the adult mobs kind of lost its effectiveness, which sometimes happens. Andi contest for that by doing a blood test to cheque for the level of the drug in your body. And also, sometimes you can develop antibodies against the drugs well
Okay.	<>
And which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that. And the other thing is that because you've had surgery in the past, that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if you've got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions. But that's quite easy to check for us well.	on which can make it ineffective so we can easily cheque that on. And the other thing is that because you've had surgery in the past, that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts re absorbed on DH, Sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if if you I got high levels of bio salts and in Europe emotions on. But that's quite easy, Tio cheque for a swell on.
Okay.	<>
And of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well, so the other thing we'll arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which you've probably done before,	Of course, you need Teo also think about whether your disease is actually floating up as well. So the other thing will arrange to do is a fickle Kyle protect in which you probably don't before
Yeah	<>
just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel.

So there's a few different options. So there is a medication called and infliximab, which is similar to Adalimumab. Or we might look at you know, switching you to a completely different drug um as well. Also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab. But yeah, I think first of all, we'll get some up to date tests on first. Might need to get a CT scan or also an MRI scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if there's any inflammation in the bowel that might be, you know, causing your symptoms.	So there's a few different options s. So there is a medication called Inflicts a map, which is similar to other little mob.

Okay, so it's what we call a chronic condition. So it's something that you're going to have life long, unfortunately, um but it's a condition that we can control very well with medications, in the vast majority of people. So to start with, we'll start you on a course of steroids. I don't think you've had any from your GP yet, but that should help to sort of calm down the inflammation in your bowel and then we'll get you started on some other maintenance therapies I'm going into details of that on at the next consultation.

Right. 	<> 
And hopefully your bowel have it should be going back to normal.	Hopefully, your habit should be going back to normal on. 
Okay.	<>
And you should know it's less blood as well. If that doesn't happen with the steroids, then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations.

And often people are on them lifelong or certainly for years, depending on the course of their disease. 	You should know it's like blood as well.

Yeah. Possibly so. We do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac. That kind of upset your stomach, especially if you're not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it. So we need to be might need to address that. Do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss. 	Yeah, possibly so. We do find people here on long time, non studio.

So, yeah, I think there's a few different things it could be. I noticed that you've not had a colonoscopy for quite some time. In fact, not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed. So we might need to look at repeating that. I think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers. And we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure there's no infection. And also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin. And, that's to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohn's disease. I think depending on what those are, well, maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel. So I think that's that's what we are doing just at that the moment. How does that sound to you? 	So, yeah, I think there's a few different things it could be. I noticed that, you know, had a colonoscopy for quite some time. In fact, know, said Teo, Shortly after you were diagnosed, we might need to look ATT Repeating that, I think in the first instance we'll get some blood tests off to take inflammatory markers. We need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure there's no infection and also send off a special student test called Faecal Cal. Protected on. That's to look for inflammation in your babble that might be related to the crew is disease. I think depending on what those are, well, maybe deciding whether you need another camera, taste up up the tail and have a look at the lining of the boat? No. And so I think that's probably doing just the moment tigers outside you. 
Yeah. I mean, yes. Yeah, that's that's all right. Yeah, I just Yeah, I didn't really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in. 	Yes, was yes, that's That's all right. I just I didn't really think you'd be getting all these tests. And things here quite looks taken.
Of course.	<> 
But yeah, I understand. 	You understand 
Any other questions? 	any other questions? 
Yeah. Do you think I need to change my medication to something else? 	You think I need to change my medication to something else? 
So one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the Adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug. But at the moment, I wouldn't change you from your Adalimumab just until we've got a bit more information about what's going on. 	So one of the things we can do is cheque, the level of the medication and your blood. I'm called Adeline a mob profile or checking antibodies and the level of the drug.

Okay. You think I might need more surgery? 	Okay. You think I might need more surgery? 
Well, again, it depends a little bit on the investigations. We might, you know, depending on what they show we might need to go on and get MRI scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there aren't any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time. If that's the case, then we might need to look at surgery. But that's a lot further down the line for a moment. Okay. 	Well, again, it depends a lot of it on the investigations. We might, you know, depending on what they Sure we might need to go on and get an M r. I scan of your battle just to have a look and make sure there aren't any other points of nattering and the guy will like you had last time.

Okay, so at the moment we need to take some stool cultures from you. I think you've had some sent, but we need to send a couple more just to exclude any infection. We also need to arrange an urgent colonoscopy for you. So that I'm sure your mom have had one of those before, so it's basically a camera test. It goes into your bowel and has a look, and we take photographs and take biopsies to try and diagnose you with what we think is inflammatory bowel disease. Okay?. There are a couple of different types of inflammatory bowel disease. So one is called ulcerative colitis like your mom has, and the other one is called crohn's disease. And so they are similar in many ways. But there are key differences in terms of how we manage people, so that's what we'll do at the moment, for today, we'll start you on something called Pentesia, which is to try and help reduce any inflammation in the bowel. And then once we get a formal diagnosis from biopsies and things, we'll hopefully aim to start you on some steroids to reduce the inflammation. Okay. Does that sound okay? 	So at the moment we need to take some stew cultures from you. I think you've had some scent, but we need to send a couple more just to exclude any infection.

It goes in to your bow and has a look, and we take photographs and take biopsies to try and and diagnose you with what we think is inflammatory bowel disease. OK, there are a couple of different types of inflammatory bowel disease. No one is called ulcer to collect us like your mom has, and the other one's Cole croons disease. And so they are similar in many ways. But there are key differences in terms of how we manage people, and so that's what we'll be at the moment for. Today we'll start you on something called Fantasia, which is to try and help reduce any inflammation in the barrel on DH. Then once we get a formal diagnosis from biopsies and things, well, hopefully in to start you on some steroids to reduce the inflammation. Does that sound okay?

So it's very dependent on the patient or on the person who some people respond very well to initial therapy. And they might remain well for years with a normal bowel habit and will kind of see you or speak to you from clinic. You know, maybe every six months for a year to see how you're getting on and decides if you can come off medication so some people stay on medication, lifelong, and some people manage to come off it.

So there's a few different things that could be going on. One of them could be that, as you sort of alluded to yourself that you might be coming. Your body's not responding as well to the Adalimumab so one of the things that we'll do today is check the levels of the drug in your body to make sure that your body is handling it as it should be. It could also be that your crohn's disease is a bit more active than usual, so one of the things that we can do for that is check up fecal calprotectin which you will probably have had done before.
