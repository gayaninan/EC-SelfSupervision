# Clinical Dialogue Transcription Error Correction with Self-supervision

## Experiment Setup

To compare the different self-supervision strategies we used two pre-trained language models, [T5](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3455716.3455856) and [BART](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.703).

Pre-trained language models were fine-tuned using [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) libraries while maintaining all default hyper-parameters. 

For the summarisation task, the encoder input and decoder output sequence lengths were set to 1024 and 128, respectively; for paraphrasing and mask-filling tasks, both encoder input and decoder sequence lengths were set to 512. 

## Datasets

`train` data contains the PubMed abstracts generated for the three self-supervision tasks (Standard, Hybrid and Domain-specific objectives).
`test` data contains the role playing clinical conversations provided by the NHS Grampian (Please note that this dataset will be available upon request).

## Reproduce Results

This codebase contains the jupyter notebook implementations for language model fine-tuning, WER evaluation and results generation and the notebooks are avaialble in the `notebooks` directory.

The fine-tuned models and the `train` dataset are currently avaialable in the Huggingface hub, however due to the anonimity requirement we have uploaded all the fine-tuned models and datasets to the folllowing Google Drive link: 
(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a5HHaCJ-zRmhfd6HNlFRF9mZ1MEkeFcl?usp=sharing). 

To use the models and datasets please extract them from the Google Drive to the `models` and `datasets` directories respectively.
